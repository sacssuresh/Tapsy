# Sound Files

Place the following sound files in this directory:

- `tile1.mp3` - Sound for tile 1 (blue)
- `tile2.mp3` - Sound for tile 2 (pink)
- `tile3.mp3` - Sound for tile 3 (mint)
- `tile4.mp3` - Sound for tile 4 (yellow)
- `gameover.mp3` - Soft game over sound

The app will gracefully handle missing sound files and continue to work without them.
